# Hyper-Graphical Models for Time-Series Analysis

This repository is the official implementation of [Hyper-Graphical Models for Time-Series Analysis]. 


## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>ğŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...


## Training

To run the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data 'data_name' --node None --degree None --print_computing_time True --draw_plot True
```
Note. This only estimate one target time sereies.

>ğŸ“‹ Input data should be one of the following strings: ['caiso', 'traffic', 'electricity', 'weather', 'etth1', 'ettm1', 'solar', 'wind', 'exchange'], or it should be a NumPy array of time series data or a list of NumPy arrays. If it is one of ['caiso', 'traffic', 'electricity', 'weather', 'etth1', 'ettm1', 'solar', 'wind', 'exchange'], the preprocessed data we used for experiments will be used for training. Details about the preprocessing procedure are provided in Section 7 and Appendix A.3.

>ğŸ“‹ Node and degree are hyperparameters of our model. In our actual code, the node can be set as a list of bin thresholds according to the user's specifications. However, here the node parameter must be either an integer or None. If the hyperparameter node and degree are chosen to be None, it automatically uses the node and degrees we used for our experiment in the paper.

>ğŸ“‹ To print the training time for each training time window, set --print_computint_time as True.

>ğŸ“‹ If draw_plot is true, the plot like is saved as 'plot.png'

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ğŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).


## Experiments with fewer data



## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ğŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
