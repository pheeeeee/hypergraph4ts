# Hyper-Graphical Models for Time-Series Analysis

This repository is the official implementation of [Hyper-Graphical Models for Time-Series Analysis]. 


## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...


## Load Data

To load datasets:

'''load data

'''

This code loads the preprocessed data we used for experiments.



## Training

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:

```train
python train.py --input-data 'data_name' --node None --degree None --print_computing_time True
```
>ðŸ“‹  Input-data should be one of string \['caiso','traffic','electricity','weather','etth1','ettm1','solar','wind','exchange'] or it should be numpy array of time series data or a list of numpy arrays.

If it is one of 'caiso','traffic','electricity','weather','etth1','ettm1','solar','wind','exchange', preprocessed data we used for experiments will be used for training.


Node and degree are hyper-parameter of our model. In our actual codes, node can be set specifically as the user wants. But for here, node parameter must be either integer or None.

If the hyperparameter node and degree are chosen to be None, it automatically uses the node and degrees we used for our experiment in the paper.

To print the training time for each training time window, set --print_computint_time as True.

## Evaluation

To evaluate my model on ImageNet, run:

```eval
python eval.py --model-file mymodel.pth --benchmark imagenet
```

>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to evaluate the trained models on benchmarks reported in the paper, give commands that produce the results (section below).


## Experiments with fewer data



## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on :

### [Image Classification on ImageNet](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet)

| Model name         | Top 1 Accuracy  | Top 5 Accuracy |
| ------------------ |---------------- | -------------- |
| My awesome model   |     85%         |      95%       |

>ðŸ“‹  Include a table of results from your paper, and link back to the leaderboard for clarity and context. If your main result is a figure, include that figure and link to the command or notebook to reproduce it.
